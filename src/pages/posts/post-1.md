This study explores how non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) affects player experience in video games. While photorealism has traditionally dominated game development, recent trends show a growing interest in stylized visual approaches. NPR techniques enable these styles by applying shading methods that reproduce artistic effects such as outlines, abstraction, or hand-drawn aesthetics. Although the technical aspects of NPR have been widely examined, there is limited research on how these visual styles influence player perception and emotional response. To address this gap, the authors conducted a comparative experiment using the Unity game *John Lemon* as a testbed. Five NPR effects were implemented to generate visually distinct versions of the same game environment, ensuring that only the graphical style varied while gameplay remained constant.

A group of fifteen participants played through each of the five versions and completed the in-game module of the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) after each session. This questionnaire evaluates multiple dimensions of player experience, including competence, sensory and imaginative immersion, flow, tension, and positive or negative affect. The collected responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, focusing on medians and distribution patterns to assess how each NPR effect influenced the player’s experience.

The results indicate that NPR styles significantly impact gameplay perception. Versions featuring clear contour lines and stylized shading tend to produce higher ratings of competence, immersion, and positive affect, while effects that reduce visibility or distort the visual field are associated with increased tension, frustration, and negative affect. These findings suggest that NPR can meaningfully shape emotional and cognitive aspects of gameplay. Rather than being a purely aesthetic choice, visual style becomes an active component in how players interpret, navigate, and emotionally respond to a game. The study concludes that understanding the experiential consequences of stylistic rendering can help designers and developers make more informed decisions when selecting or crafting graphical styles for their projects.
